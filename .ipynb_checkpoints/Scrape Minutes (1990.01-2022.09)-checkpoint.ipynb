      "The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in the foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n",
      "The information received at this meeting suggested that final demand had expanded at a solid pace in the second quarter, led by a surge in net exports and another robust gain in residential investment, while business investment and consumer spending rose at moderate rates.  The labor market continued to improve gradually in June and July.  Core CPI and PCE prices decelerated in recent months, after notable increases earlier in the year.  Crude oil prices continued to rise, reaching record levels in nominal terms over the intermeeting period. \n",
      "Payroll employment grew in June and July at a pace that was roughly on par with that over the preceding six months.  Hiring in the services and construction sectors remained strong, but the manufacturing sector posted further small job losses.  With employment increasing and the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers unchanged over these two months, aggregate hours continued to firm.  The unemployment rate dipped to 5.0 percent in June and held steady at that rate in July.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained at low levels.    \t\n",
      "Industrial production picked up in June.  A jump in utilities output, apparently owing to unseasonably warm weather, accounted for more than half of the gain.  Motor vehicle production also rose a good bit, but the pace of production growth in the high-tech sector was sluggish, reflecting a decline in the output of communications equipment.  Overall capacity utilization moved up to its highest level since December 2000.\n",
      "Real personal consumption expenditures increased at a moderate pace in the second quarter, buoyed by a surge in purchases of motor vehicles that appeared to be due largely to the extension by an automaker of its \"employee discount\" program to the general public.  Excluding spending on motor vehicles, the growth of real personal consumption expenditures slowed slightly in the second quarter.  Survey measures of consumer confidence continued to be quite favorable in July.  \n",
      "Activity in the housing sector remained robust.  In June, starts of single-family homes maintained the strong pace of earlier this year.  Both new and existing home sales jumped.  Mortgage rates remained low, and house prices apparently continued to rise briskly.  \n",
      "Business spending on equipment and software posted a solid increase in the second quarter, boosted by a surge in outlays for transportation equipment.  Excluding this volatile component, business spending on equipment and software decelerated markedly in the second quarter.  Spending on nonresidential construction remained subdued.  Nonetheless, fundamentals appeared to continue to support business investment, with the user cost of capital still low and corporations experiencing strong cash flows and holding ample liquid assets.\n",
      "Real nonfarm inventories edged down in the second quarter, after a substantial rise in the first quarter.  The strong pace of motor vehicle sales contributed to the runoff of inventories in the second quarter.  Outside the automobile sector, real nonfarm inventories continued to rise, but at a much slower pace than earlier in the year.  The inventory-sales ratio for the nonfarm business sector declined further from an already low level, continuing its long-term downward trend.\n",
      "The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in May as the value of exports of goods and services rose slightly and the value of imports declined, partly reflecting a sharp drop in the value of oil imports.  GDP growth in a number of major foreign industrial economies appeared to have slowed a bit in the second quarter.\n",
      "Consumer prices were about unchanged in June after posting notable increases earlier in the year.  Consumer energy prices reversed a small part of their previous run-up, and core consumer inflation remained low.  The producer price index was unchanged in June.  The annual revisions to the national income and product accounts, which were released in early August, included a substantial upward revision to core PCE inflation for 2004, from 1.6 percent to 2.2 percent, reflecting changes to the nonmarket-based components of the index.  Survey measures of near-term inflation expectations edged down in July, and longer-term inflation expectations firmed only a touch.  The employment cost index for private industry workers again rose at a modest pace in the second quarter, and increases in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector slowed somewhat from the rapid rate of the first quarter. \n",
      "At its June meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 3¼ percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  In addition, the Committee noted that the expansion remained firm, that labor market conditions continued to improve gradually, and that, although pressures on inflation had remained elevated, longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained.  In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.  \n",
      "The Committee's decision at its June meeting to raise the intended level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to maintain an assessment that risks to the goals of price stability and sustained growth were balanced assuming appropriate monetary policy action, and to retain the \"measured pace\" language was widely expected in financial markets.  Over the intermeeting period, however, investors appreciably marked up their expectations for the path of policy, primarily in response to incoming economic data suggesting more strength in spending and output than had been anticipated.  Nominal Treasury yields increased in line with the revision to policy expectations.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose a touch less than their nominal counterparts, leaving inflation compensation only slightly higher.  Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were little changed over the intermeeting period, but those on speculative-grade bonds declined markedly, ending the period close to the very low levels reached earlier this year.  Major equity indexes advanced, supported by strong corporate earnings reports.  The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.  The People's Bank of China announced a change to its exchange-rate regime, including an immediate 2.1 percent appreciation of the renminbi versus the dollar.\n",
      "M2 continued to grow sluggishly on balance over June and July.  Small time deposits, whose rates of return adjust relatively quickly to changes in market rates, expanded briskly.  However, liquid deposits and retail money market mutual funds were little changed on net over these two months.  Despite the recent slow growth of M2, its velocity remained low relative to the level that would be expected based on its historical relationship with opportunity cost.  The growth of bank credit was restrained in June by a runoff in securities holdings but picked up in July.\n",
      " In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff raised its projection for economic growth over the remainder of 2005 in light of incoming data suggesting greater near-term momentum in aggregate demand.  At the same time, however, it trimmed the growth rate forecast for 2006, reflecting the effects of higher energy prices, higher long-term interest rates, and the somewhat slower growth of productive capacity implied by the annual revisions to the national accounts.  The output gap was predicted to be essentially closed by the end of this year.  Inventory investment was projected to resume contributing to GDP growth over the second half of this year, after the sharp swing toward inventory runoffs in the second quarter.  Growth in consumer spending was expected to firm in the third quarter, buoyed by motor vehicle spending, before falling back in the fourth quarter.  With housing starts essentially flat, residential investment was projected to decelerate substantially over the remainder of this year.  Business investment was predicted to continue to rise at a moderate pace, benefiting from still-accommodative financial conditions and the ongoing need to replace depreciating equipment and software.  The recent improvement in the trade balance was expected to be transitory.  Notwithstanding recent benign readings on inflation, the forecast for core PCE inflation was raised somewhat, owing in part to the recent further rise in energy prices and, in light of the revisions to historical data, a higher assumed trajectory for the nonmarket component of core PCE prices.\n",
      "In their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook, meeting participants noted that aggregate spending appeared to have picked up in recent months by more than anticipated and that current estimates of slack were narrower than those reviewed at the June meeting.  In addition, high and rising energy prices were adding to pressures on overall inflation, and energy price increases probably would feed through, at least temporarily, to core measures of inflation.  Nonetheless, core inflation recently had been relatively low and inflation expectations remained well contained.  Moreover, participants thought that some slowing in final sales was likely later this year as net exports resumed their decline and purchases of automobiles fell back with the expiration of special discount programs.  In these circumstances, it appeared that, for now, continued removal of policy accommodation at a measured pace still would likely be sufficient to keep inflation contained, but participants also recognized that the pace and cumulative extent of policy adjustment going forward would depend importantly on economic developments.  \n",
      "In the household sector, the path for spending was expected to be bolstered in the near term by still-low interest rates, solid growth in disposable income, and ongoing increases in wealth.  However, elevated energy prices were seen as likely to be a significant drag on consumption and, on net, household spending was expected to advance at a moderate pace.  Housing sales and construction activity generally remained strong across the country, but meeting participants noted anecdotal evidence of some cooling in housing markets in certain areas.  And at least some banks were reportedly beginning to apply somewhat tighter standards in real estate lending and becoming more cautious in their promotion of nontraditional mortgage products.  Participants generally anticipated that the pace of home price appreciation would slow over time, though the timing and extent of that slowing, as well as its implications for consumer spending, were quite uncertain.\n",
      "Participants indicated that business investment had been evolving roughly in line with their expectations.  Strong fundamentals, including low interest rates, wide profit margins, and a high level of liquid assets, were seen as supporting expenditures on software and equipment going forward.  Inventory investment declined in the second quarter, with much of the falloff concentrated in the motor vehicle industry, where sales had been boosted sharply by the introduction of special discount programs.  Inventories now seemed to be coming in line with the trend in final demand and were anticipated to expand along with sales later this year.\n",
      "Participants viewed the increases in market interest rates over the intermeeting period as an appropriate response to the stronger economic outlook.  A few participants voiced concerns that still-low interest rates and insufficient recognition by investors of the dependency of the Committee's policy expectations on economic data were continuing to foster an inappropriate degree of risk-taking in financial markets.  Another participant mentioned, however, that recent sluggish growth of the monetary aggregates suggested that the stance of policy was not overly accommodative.  Moreover, with a higher proportion of mortgages now tied to short-term rates, it was noted that increases in short-term rates could have a somewhat larger-than-usual effect on spending.  On balance, current financial conditions, which embedded expectations of future policy tightening, were generally seen as likely to be consistent with sustained moderate economic growth and containment of pressures on inflation in coming quarters.\n",
      "Regarding the federal budget, a recent narrowing of the deficit was noted, but the improvement appeared to be attributable to cyclical factors and to increases in the level of tax collections that were not likely to be repeated.  Few signs were evident that greater fiscal discipline in the budget process would emerge any time soon.  As a result, federal deficits were expected to continue to act as a considerable drain on national saving over the longer run.  \n",
      "Although net exports had been significantly higher over the second quarter than had been expected, participants did not see this development as signaling the beginning of a sustained improvement in the trade and current account balances.  The strong advance in exports and weakness in imports in the second quarter seemed largely attributable to special factors.  Continued brisk import growth appeared likely to be sustained for the foreseeable future by gains in domestic demand. \n",
      "Participants discussed at length the factors affecting costs and prices.  Although uncertainties about the underlying pace of productivity increases, trends in labor force participation, and the level of potential output complicated the inflation outlook, higher energy prices and reduced resource slack were seen as pointing to elevated inflation pressures.  While recent monthly readings indicated that core inflation had been subdued, a number of participants noted that underlying core inflation appeared to be running at a pace around the upper end of the range they viewed as consistent with price stability-an assessment that was reinforced by the recent upward revisions to historical data on core PCE inflation.  Participants commented that an increase in inflation from recent rates could have especially adverse effects on longer-run economic performance.  \n",
      "While most participants viewed the risks to inflation as having ticked up over the intermeeting period, many also cited factors that, in concert with the likely continued removal of policy accommodation, would tend to hold inflation pressures in check.  For example, few indications had emerged recently that businesses had enjoyed any significant increase in pricing power, and the continuing expansion of global trade was seen as an important factor limiting firms' ability to pass through cost increases.  In these circumstances and with markups at relatively high levels, a substantial proportion of any increases in business costs might well be reflected in narrower profit margins.  Moreover, the recent relatively low monthly readings on core inflation and modest wage pressures, at least by some measures, suggested that some slack remained in resource utilization.  Despite the rise in oil prices and quickening pace of economic activity, both market- and survey-based measures of inflation expectations seemed to remain quite well anchored.\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all of the members favored raising the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3½ percent at this meeting.  Even with this action, the federal funds rate would remain below the level that members anticipated would prove necessary to contain inflation pressures and keep output near potential, and thus in all likelihood further policy action would be required.  However, the pace of future policy moves, although likely to be measured, as well as the extent of those moves, would depend on incoming data. \n",
      "In discussing the statement to be released after the meeting, members agreed that it was appropriate to highlight the apparent strengthening in aggregate spending.  Policymakers exchanged views on the characterization of labor market conditions in light of recent employment reports and other indicators, but members ultimately concurred that the description of labor markets as \"improving gradually\" remained appropriate.  Members agreed that it was appropriate to acknowledge the recent relatively low monthly rates of core inflation, but also to emphasize that inflation pressures remained elevated.  As in past meetings, there was some discussion about the desirability of including forward-looking language in the statement, but members agreed to retain the forward-looking language for now.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth had been sluggish on balance since midsummer. Housing demand remained strong, but business fixed investment was still in the doldrums and consumer spending had flagged in late summer before apparently picking up somewhat in the autumn. Payroll employment had changed little since midyear, and industrial production still seemed to be on a downward trend. Most price indexes continued to indicate that inflation had declined over the past year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Private nonfarm payroll employment remained stagnant in the third quarter and edged down in October and November. Job losses in manufacturing were again large in the two months, and employment declined in construction and in the wholesale and retail trade industries. By contrast, services (except help-supply) and the finance, insurance, and real estate grouping recorded further solid gains. The unemployment rate rose to 6 percent in November, a level more consonant with other recent labor market indicators. Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector continued to climb briskly, with the advance over the last four quarters being the largest since 1973.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Industrial production dropped sharply further in October, with roughly half of the decline related to a slowdown in motor vehicle assemblies and the manufacture of related parts. The rest of the manufacturing sector also was weak on balance, with output down in almost all market groups. The high-tech sector was an exception, although the rise in output of computers and semiconductors in October was smaller than earlier in the year and the production of communications equipment continued to fall. Consistent with the poor performance of industrial production, capacity utilization in manufacturing fell again in October and remained substantially below its long-run average.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Against the backdrop of smaller gains in disposable personal income and low readings on consumer confidence, growth of consumer spending had been quite sluggish in the last several months. Much of the weakness reflected a falloff in spending on new motor vehicles in September and October, largely because of reduced manufacturer discounts. Apart from motor vehicles, personal consumption expenditures picked up in October following two months of softness. Increases in outlays for services in September and October remained modest and about equal to the average rate of rise earlier in the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Housing starts dropped moderately in October, which was an unusually wet month across much of the country. However, residential housing activity had been very strong on balance this year despite an environment of sluggish employment and declining household wealth. Mortgage rates near historical lows had provided important support for single-family housing demand, and sales of new and existing homes had remained buoyant. In the multifamily sector, starts plunged in October to the slowest pace in almost six years. While some of the decline likely was attributable to inclement weather, apartment vacancy rates had risen significantly over the past year, perhaps partly in response to the single-family housing boom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Business spending on equipment and software increased moderately in the third quarter, but the recent monthly pattern of data on shipments and orders for nondefense capital goods, along with anecdotal reports from businesses, signaled renewed weakness. Shipments of nondefense capital goods rebounded in October, led by a rise in computing equipment. In contrast, shipments of communications equipment plunged. Construction in the nonresidential sector slowed sharply further in the third quarter, but a few signs, including a rise in activity in October, suggested some moderation in the rate of decline.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The aggregate book value of manufacturing inventories changed little in October: declines in stocks of many types of durable goods were offset by modest stockbuilding of nondurables, and the ratio of stocks to shipments remained very low. Anecdotal information suggested that disruptions of West Coast dock operations stemming from a labor dispute had been quite small.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services changed little in September and the third quarter. The available information on economic activity abroad in the third quarter indicated that economic expansion remained moderate in the United Kingdom and sluggish in the euro area. Economic growth subsided somewhat from elevated second-quarter rates in Canada, Japan, and emerging Asia. Economic conditions in South America were generally still fragile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Core consumer price inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) and the chain-weighted personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, continued to trend lower in October. Inflation, in terms of both indexes, was down over the last twelve months when compared with the previous twelve-month period. At the producer level, core price inflation for finished goods over the twelve months ended in October was at a very low rate. With regard to labor costs, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased moderately in November, and the growth in those earnings over the last twelve months fell considerably, evidently reflecting the slack in labor markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At its meeting on November 6, 2002, the Committee adopted a directive that called for lowering the target for the intended federal funds rate by 50 basis points, to 1-1/4 percent. The Committee also agreed that, in light of the decision to ease, it would be appropriate to indicate in the press release that the risks were balanced for the foreseeable future. Market participants had expected a 25 basis point cut and retention of a statement of risks toward weakness. The unexpectedly large reduction in the federal funds rate target led to an initial decline in Treasury coupon yields. That drop was reversed when market participants apparently focused on the shift to balanced risks and concluded that the odds of pronounced economic weakness had fallen. The subsequent release of better-than-expected economic data and earnings news provided reassurance to investors, though more mixed economic reports became available late in the intermeeting period. Over the period as a whole, major equity indexes registered mixed changes, and yields on longer-term Treasury bonds increased somewhat. In private debt markets, rates on investment-grade debt issues eased a little, and those on speculative-grade bonds fell considerably more.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The dollar appreciated slightly in terms of an index of major foreign currencies, principally against the yen, and changed little against the currencies of other important trading partners. The dollar edged lower against most major currencies in the aftermath of the policy easing on November 6, but those losses were subsequently retraced after the release of U.S. economic data that were seen as suggesting relatively better economic conditions in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "M2 growth slowed a little in November from October's elevated pace. The further advance again was concentrated in liquid deposits. The low level of opportunity costs and heavy mortgage financing continued to support the demand for liquid assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would be relatively muted over the near term. Faced with heightened geopolitical tensions as well as persisting concerns about the near-term course of economic activity and corporate earnings, businesses and households were likely to hold down their spending, and the outlook for continued sluggish economic growth among most major trading partners would damp U.S. exports. However, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time, and the considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place, continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending. Inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels. As a consequence, a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits, low financing costs, and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to provide a gradual boost to business investment spending. The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster a slight moderation in core price inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members noted that the recent information had continued on the whole to suggest quite sluggish economic growth. Uncertainties about the outlook remained substantial, and downside risks stemming from potential shocks, notably those associated with a high level of geopolitical risks, could not be dismissed. Nonetheless, the behavior of financial markets in recent weeks suggested that investor concerns about an actual downturn in the economy had diminished, as data on economic developments took on a more mixed tone after having been somewhat negative for some time. The improvement in financial markets reinforced the members' expectations that a gradual strengthening of the economic expansion was likely over coming quarters, with the growth in economic activity gaining momentum over time in the absence of major adverse shocks to business and consumer confidence. Their assessment took account of the currently very accommodative stance of monetary policy, likely further fiscal policy stimulus, and the positive effects on business and consumer spending of a strong uptrend in labor productivity.  With regard to the outlook for inflation, the gap between actual and potential output was anticipated to diminish only slowly unless aggregate demand expanded much more rapidly than the members currently foresaw. Given the persistence of limited pressures on resources, cost and price increases were expected to remain subdued and possibly to edge lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The improvement of overall conditions in financial markets had provided an additional positive element to the economic outlook. The improvement began before the November meeting and had been given added impetus by the Committee's sizable easing at that meeting. The general calming of financial markets was reflected in some decline in risk spreads from very high levels and sizable new issuance in private bond markets; in equity markets, issuance had edged up and stock prices, though recently declining somewhat, were still well above the lows of early October. Some of this improvement in financial markets seemed to be related to apparently lessening concerns about new revelations of corporate governance issues as a result of the passage of time without further significant incidents. In addition, many business firms had continued to enhance their prospects for rising profits through productivity improvements and debt restructurings that were strengthening their balance sheets and liquidity. Concurrently, indicators of credit quality in the household sector appeared to have remained essentially stable. Reference also was made to the continued robust growth in reserve and money measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The better tone in financial markets might also have been signaling a modest reduction in uncertainty and risk aversion among business executives from the extraordinarily elevated levels that had been constraining investment spending. Lingering excess capacity in a number of industries undoubtedly was continuing to inhibit new investment outlays as well. The members agreed that a pickup in capital spending remained the essential factor in the outlook for substantial strengthening of economic activity. On the positive side, spending for business equipment had turned up since early this year, and with efforts to reduce excess capacity seemingly well under way or completed in many industries, further firming in such capital expenditures was anticipated as the year 2003 progressed. However, nonresidential building was expected to continue to lag, especially given high vacancy rates in industrial and office structures in many major markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The household sector of the economy had continued to provide major support to the recovery in economic activity. The increase in consumer spending evidently had moderated in the current quarter, largely as a result of a decline in sales of motor vehicles from an extraordinary pace during the summer. However, the latest information on retail sales, including anecdotal reports, pointed to some improvement in recent weeks, and key measures of consumer confidence had turned up from their recent lows. While some uncertainty surrounded the prospects for consumer spending, members cited continued sizable increases in income, more stable wealth-to-income ratios, and the ongoing stimulus of equity extractions from housing as favorable factors in the outlook for consumer expenditures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Housing activity had continued to display solid overall strength, though members mentioned weakness in multifamily construction and the high-end sector of the single-family market. Historically low mortgage interest rates along with rising incomes evidently were continuing to sustain the robust demand for housing.  In addition, large extractions of equity from appreciated housing values continued to foster not only added consumer spending but also improvement in the financial condition of many households through debt consolidation and repayments and reduced interest charges. However, there were anecdotal indications of decreasing refinancing activity in the housing sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The outcome of the recent Congressional elections had fostered expectations that fiscal policy might be more expansive than previously anticipated, although the size, timing, and composition of federal budget initiatives were subject to substantial uncertainty.  Members commented that added fiscal stimulus might prove to be a useful complement to an accommodative monetary policy in the period immediately ahead when economic activity was likely to remain below the economy's potential. In this regard, some observed that additional stimulus on the federal level would be an offset to measures that were being taken by numerous state and local governments to address severe budget deficits. At the same time, a number of members expressed the hope that new fiscal legislation would not endanger the prospects for federal budget discipline over the longer run, given the desirability of supporting national saving and capital accumulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to the external sector, members commented that the growth of the nation's important trading partners had remained sluggish, and there seemed to be little basis for anticipating any appreciable impetus to the U.S. economy from significant strengthening in demand for U.S. exports. Indeed, economic growth abroad was widely viewed as dependent to a significant extent on the performance of the U.S. economy. Conditions in some major Latin American countries were especially problematic, and adverse developments there could have negative repercussions on international financial markets and trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Members believed that the economy probably would continue to operate with significant margins of slack in both labor and product markets. Moreover, in an environment characterized by highly competitive markets and the absence of pricing power, business firms would persist in their efforts to hold down or reduce costs, with favorable implications for productivity. In these circumstances, inflation pressures could be expected to remain subdued and some further disinflation might well occur. In this regard, members commented that appreciable disinflation seemed unlikely, but if that were to occur it could present difficult problems for monetary policy.  One member noted, however, that declining inflation or even some deflation in the context of rapid growth in productivity could turn out to be relatively benign.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to retain the current stance of policy. The members agreed that, given what was now a quite accommodative policy following the relatively aggressive easing move in November, monetary policy was well positioned to support a strengthening economic expansion in line with their expectations for coming quarters. Although it was uncertain how long the current period of below-par growth would persist, the economic outlook remained subject to upside as well as downside risks. Indeed, all the members also supported the retention of the current balanced-risks statement in the post-meeting press release, with some commenting that recent developments had established a firmer basis for such a risk assessment than at the November meeting when it was adopted. The November easing had contributed to some improvement in financial markets that, in conjunction with prospects for further stimulus from fiscal policy, should bolster the anticipated acceleration of economic activity. At the same time, the members saw little risk of any significant increase in inflationary pressures over the foreseeable future. Against this background, the members concluded that there was no need to change the stance of monetary policy; they would continue to assess emerging economic and financial developments, retaining the flexibility to adjust monetary policy as emerging conditions might warrant.\n",

      "The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that, before the landfall of Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast, expansion of economic activity had been solid, led by robust gains in housing and buoyant consumer spending.  While business investment appeared to be losing some momentum, labor markets continued to improve, and increases in core CPI and PCE prices were modest after notable increases earlier in the year.  Only limited data bearing on the likely economic effects of the hurricane were available.  Oil and gasoline prices, however, were on the rise, spiking to record levels in the days immediately following the hurricane.\n",

      "Payroll employment grew at a good pace in August, and the average increase over the most recent three months was largely on par with the advances made since the fourth quarter of last year.  Employment gains were widespread across industries, with the exception of the manufacturing sector, which continued to post small job losses.  With employment increasing and the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers unchanged in August, aggregate hours continued to firm modestly.  The unemployment rate dipped to 4.9 percent in August, its lowest level since August 2001.  Given the increase in the labor-force participation rate reported for the month, the employment-population ratio rose to its highest level in three years.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance jumped in the latest available week, however, as workers in the Gulf Coast region began to file claims.\n",

      "\n",
      " \n",

      "Industrial production increased only slightly in August; the staff estimated that the curtailment of activity as a result of Hurricane Katrina shaved 0.3 percent from the index.  Petroleum refining and crude oil and natural gas extraction were especially hard hit by the storm.  The output of utilities declined in August after surging earlier in the summer in response to unseasonably warm weather.  Higher production of motor vehicles and parts boosted manufacturing output.  After slowing in the second quarter, the pace of production in the high-tech sector accelerated somewhat in recent months, owing to increased output of communications equipment and semiconductors.  Overall capacity utilization through August remained close to its highest level since December 2000.\n",

      "Real personal consumption expenditures, boosted by motor vehicles purchases in response to employee-discount programs, were robust during the summer.  Spending on goods outside the automobile sector and on services was moderate.  Strong overall spending along with lackluster real income growth put downward pressure on the saving rate.  Survey measures of consumer confidence early in August were generally consistent with solid increases in spending, but confidence fell appreciably in the period immediately after the storm.\n",

      "Activity in the housing sector remained brisk.  Starts of new single-family homes in July were slightly above their average level for the first half of the year.  New home sales advanced further in July, and existing home sales stayed elevated.  Mortgage rates remained low and supported demand.  Prices of existing homes again rose briskly, while price appreciation for new homes moderated somewhat.\n",

      "The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed somewhat in July, as the value of exports of goods and services rose slightly and the value of imports declined.  The value of oil imports increased strongly in July but that rise was offset by decreases in imports of services and of non-oil goods.  GDP growth in foreign industrial economies picked up, on balance, in the second quarter, but performance across economies was mixed.\n",

      "Core consumer price inflation remained benign in July and August.  However, the surge in energy prices considerably boosted overall consumer price inflation over those months.  Gasoline prices in particular rose steeply in August, and survey data pointed to a larger increase in early September.  Producer price inflation was subdued.  One survey of households in early September indicated that near-term inflation expectations jumped and that longer-term inflation expectations edged higher.  With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for private industry workers rose at a modest pace in the second quarter, and the twelve-month change in this index declined from that of a year earlier.  Average hourly earnings rose only moderately over the past twelve months.\n",

      "At its August meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 3-1/2 percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  In addition, the Committee noted that, despite high energy prices, aggregate spending appeared to have strengthened, labor market conditions continued to improve gradually, and longer-term inflation expectations remained well contained, although pressures on inflation had stayed elevated.  In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. \n",

      "The Committee's decision at its August meeting was widely expected in financial markets and evoked little price reaction.  Over the intermeeting period, however, investors marked down their expectations for the path of policy, partly in response to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina.  Nominal Treasury yields decreased about in line with the revision to policy expectations.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities fell a bit more than their nominal counterparts, leaving inflation compensation slightly higher.  Spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were little changed over the intermeeting period, but those on speculative-grade bonds increased from very low levels.  Major equity indexes appeared to be supported by lower interest rates and posted modest gains despite the increases in energy prices.  The trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.\n",

      "M2 grew moderately, on balance, in August.  Liquid deposits edged higher, but retail money market mutual funds contracted, on net.  Small time deposits, whose rates of return adjust relatively quickly to changes in market rates, continued to expand rapidly.  The growth of bank credit surged, as loans expanded briskly.\n",

      "In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff lowered its projection for economic growth over the remainder of 2005 in light of the economic dislocation associated with Hurricane Katrina.  At the same time, however, the staff increased the growth rate forecast for 2006 to reflect the boost to economic activity from the rebuilding effort.  By 2007, the level of output was expected to move back to the path it would have followed in the absence of the storm.  The staff revised upward its forecast of overall inflation for 2005 and of core inflation for 2006, reflecting the effects of higher energy prices, but lowered its projection for overall inflation slightly for 2006.  It was recognized that there were considerable near-term uncertainties and that many data series in coming months would be influenced by the effects of the storm.\n",

      "\n",
      "In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants agreed that output and employment appeared to have been growing at a good pace before Hurricane Katrina's landfall.  Business fixed investment had been a little softer than expected, but household spending had been especially strong.  Participants agreed that the widespread devastation in the Gulf Coast region and the dislocation of many people would hold down indicators of spending for a time.  But they also were of the view that aggregate demand and output would likely rebound before long, fueled in part by private spending to rebuild and outlays by the federal government to assist in the recovery.  With growth of the economy expected to recover, meeting participants were concerned that price pressures, which had been elevated before the storm, could climb further, primarily as a result of additional increases in energy prices. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Meeting participants recognized that Hurricane Katrina would have significant effects on the U.S. economy, but the size and timing of those effects were uncertain.  Economic activity in the Gulf Coast region would be disrupted by the destruction of capital and the displacement of a large population, perhaps for an extended period.  Moreover, damage to infrastructure for extracting and processing oil and natural gas was expected to be substantial, with significant near-term implications for energy prices and the national economy, and the projected track of Hurricane Rita raised additional concerns.  In that environment, the prices of crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline likely would remain elevated and subject to considerable volatility, particularly given the limited spare capacity available in energy extraction and refining industries.  Participants noted that very substantial rebuilding would probably be underway soon, supported importantly by government programs.  The pace at which reconstruction activity would take place, however, was uncertain, as it depended in part on factors that were still difficult to assess, such as how quickly the affected areas could again be made habitable.  On balance, participants thought that there would likely be a significant shift in the timing of aggregate economic activity over the next several quarters but probably little effect on the economy's intermediate-term growth prospects.  Several participants voiced concern that the effects of the hurricane were likely to add to already considerable pressures on prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For the nation as a whole, participants noted that household spending had been fairly robust before the hurricane, supported by strong advances in income and continuing gains in wealth that reflected in part further large increases in home prices.   Most anecdotal information supported the indications from available data that activity in housing markets generally remained brisk.  The termination of some inducements to purchase motor vehicles was expected to retard expenditures on consumer durables in the latter part of this year.  The reduction in real disposable incomes caused by large increases in consumer energy prices was also anticipated to restrain consumer spending, with business contacts indicating that retail outlets that typically serve lower- and middle-income households could see particular weakness.  The reduction in spending as a result of higher energy prices and hurricane-related dislocations could be augmented by a weakening of consumer attitudes.  Many of the restraining effects were thought likely to dissipate over time, however.  Retail energy prices were likely to retrace at least a portion of the post-hurricane increase, and consumer confidence should rebound.  Moreover, demands for consumer durables, as well as housing, would receive support as hurricane victims repaired or replaced lost property, with help from insurance payments and government transfers.  Although uncertainties about the outlook for spending had increased, it appeared that, over time, consumption would probably expand at a moderate pace--perhaps a little below the pace of income growth once the increases in house prices slowed to more historically typical rates. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Meeting participants noted that, even prior to the hurricane, business fixed investment had been somewhat weaker than expected.  The softness was somewhat puzzling, as sales were growing, business balance sheets appeared quite strong in the aggregate, profitability was high, and financing was readily available and relatively inexpensive for most firms.  Although the apparent sluggishness could reflect only short-term fluctuations in volatile data series, some evidence suggested that it may also have stemmed from concern among business executives about the effects of high energy prices.  The anecdotal information on commercial real estate markets was mixed, with some districts reporting firming markets while activity elsewhere was said to remain subpar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to fiscal policy, meeting participants noted that federal outlays would increase sharply in order to assist with recovery and reconstruction efforts in the aftermath of the hurricane.  The eventual size of the increment to federal outlays was unclear, but it was likely to be quite large.  The substantial step-up in government spending would add to federal deficits that were already large and underscored the worrisome loss of fiscal discipline evident in recent years.  The expansion of federal spending implied an increase in fiscal stimulus at a time when the margin of unutilized resources in the overall economy was probably thin. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Participants' concerns about inflation prospects generally had increased over the intermeeting period.  The surge in energy prices, in particular, was boosting overall inflation, and some of that increase would probably pass through for a time into core prices.  This posed the risk that there could be a more persistent influence on inflation should inflation expectations rise.  Indeed, some recent survey evidence on such expectations had been troubling, and widening federal deficits were mentioned as a factor that could further stir inflationary concerns.  Measures of labor costs were giving conflicting signals, with some indexes indicating that growth in labor compensation remained relatively low but another showing appreciably more rapid increases.  Anecdotal information continued to point to shortages of certain types of labor, such as truck drivers, and some business contacts reported difficulties in hiring more generally, a development that had prompted some firms to boost wages.  Underlying productivity growth to date apparently had remained robust but, at this stage of the business cycle, gains in productivity could not necessarily be counted on to stay strong.  The prices of a number of intermediate goods, including a wide range of petrochemical products and building materials, were subject to upward pressure, reflecting high crude oil prices, production disruptions in the energy sector, and elevated demands for materials in anticipation of rebuilding in the Gulf Coast region.  Still, core inflation in recent months had been quite damped, and market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had risen only modestly of late.  It was observed that, after the early 1980s, the pass-through of energy prices into core inflation had been quite limited, suggesting that, in current circumstances, core inflation could stay relatively low and overall inflation would probably drop back if inflation expectations remained contained.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 3-3/4 percent at this meeting.  Although uncertainty had increased, in the Committee's judgment the fundamental factors influencing the longer-term path of the economy probably had not been affected by the hurricane, but the upside risks to inflation appeared to have increased.  Even after today's action, the federal funds rate would likely be below the level that would be necessary to contain inflationary pressures, and further rate increases probably would be required.  Moreover, the uncertainties about near-term economic prospects resulting from Hurricane Katrina would probably not be reduced materially in coming weeks.  Indeed, underlying economic trends would be particularly difficult to assess over the next several months as a result of the direct, and presumably temporary, effects of the storm and its aftermath on the incoming data.  A pause in policy tightening at this meeting had the potential to mislead the public both about the Committee's perceptions of the fundamental strength and resilience of the economy and about its commitment to fostering price stability.\n",

      "In discussing the statement to be released after the meeting, members agreed that it would be appropriate to characterize the macroeconomic effects of Hurricane Katrina, while significant, as essentially temporary.  Members also believed that the statement should again note that both monetary policy accommodation and robust underlying productivity growth were continuing to support economic activity.  Although energy prices had the potential to add to inflation pressures, and inflation expectations had recently exhibited some signs of increasing, members agreed that the risks to inflation, as well as those to growth, remained essentially balanced under an assumption of appropriate policy action.  The Committee also agreed to reiterate its previous expectation that \". . . policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.\"  However, some sentiment was expressed to consider changes to forward-looking aspects of the statement at upcoming meetings, in part because of the considerable reduction in monetary policy accommodation that had already been accomplished.\n",

      "By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on September 21, 2004, were approved.\n",
      "By unanimous vote, the Federal Open Market Committee approved the selection of Deborah J. Danker as Deputy Secretary of the Committee to serve until the selection of a successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting after December 31, 2004.\n",
      "The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account in the period since the previous meeting.\n",
      "The Manager reported on recent developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period September 21, 2004, through November 9, 2004.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n",
      "The Manager also discussed the pressures on the federal funds rate prior to, and volatility in the rate that has ensued at times after, recent FOMC meetings as depository institutions sought to satisfy a larger portion of their reserve requirements before anticipated increases in the FOMC’s target funds rate.  The Committee agreed that the Desk would continue to conduct open market operations as it has in such situations--leaning against anticipatory pressures in the funds market while taking account of the reserve management implications of such operations for the remainder of the reserve maintenance period.  \n",
      "The information received at this meeting suggested that the economy expanded at a moderate pace over the third quarter.  Low interest rates helped to maintain a buoyant housing market and spending by both consumers and businesses was firm.  Available information suggested that the recent tempo of economic activity continued into the current quarter despite the restraint imparted on real incomes and consumer confidence from higher oil prices.  However, industrial production was flat in recent months, and hiring activity was lackluster through September before advancing sharply in October.  Inflation measures continued at low levels through September.\n",
      "Employment gains were subdued in the third quarter, but showed substantial strength in October.  Job growth last month was fairly widespread, although heavy hiring in the construction sector was due partly to efforts to repair damage from the four hurricanes that hit the southeastern states.  Employment increases were particularly large in the financial and services sectors.  However, a small decline was registered in employment in the manufacturing sector.  The average workweek held steady in October at its third-quarter level and was a bit above the average for the second quarter.  Despite the strong increase in payroll employment, the household survey indicated a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent in October.\n",
      "Industrial production was about unchanged in September, likely restrained by the hurricanes that month.  A decline in manufacturing was about offset by a jump in utilities output and expansion in high-tech industries.  The available data suggested that industrial production rebounded in October.  Capacity utilization was unchanged in September at about the third-quarter average but was up from its level earlier in the year.\n",
      "Consumer spending advanced strongly in the third quarter from the sluggish pace of the second quarter.  The acceleration reflected a surge in expenditures on motor vehicles that owed partly to attractive incentives, but spending on other durables and nondurables was also up.  Spending on services was steady for the third quarter on average, but advanced in September on a boost to electricity consumption related to unseasonably warm weather.  Real disposable income slowed in the third quarter to a moderate pace and was flat in September, probably in part because of effects of the hurricanes.  Measures of consumer confidence moved down in September and again in October.  Activity in housing markets remained generally strong in September, supported by favorable mortgage rates.  Although starts of single-family homes slowed to well below the level of preceding months, multifamily starts rose and sales of both existing and new homes were elevated. \n",
      "Business investment spending on equipment and software continued to expand at a rapid pace in the third quarter, supported by positive fundamentals that included robust business output, low interest rates and readily available credit, and healthy business balance sheets.  Outlays for high-tech equipment and software stepped down in the third quarter, but spending on other types of equipment, including transportation, was at a high level.  At the same time, investment in nonresidential structures, which had turned up in the second quarter, softened in the third quarter.  Construction spending for retail buildings and warehouses advanced, but high vacancy rates for office buildings held back investment in that sector.\n",
      "Accumulation of nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles picked up smartly over the third quarter.  The level of sales also rose, however, keeping inventory-sales ratios fairly steady at low levels.\n",
      "The U.S. international trade deficit rose in the third quarter on average, reflecting some weakening in the growth of service exports and an increase in the price and quantity of petroleum imports.  The deficit narrowed in September, however, as imports fell while exports expanded moderately.  The lower level of imports in September mainly reflected declines in the petroleum and services categories.  Economic expansion abroad on average appeared to slow in the third quarter, although it remained solid.  \n",
      "Consumer prices continued to advance at a moderate rate in recent months, although both overall and core consumer price measures rose a bit faster in the twelve months ending in September 2004 than in the year-earlier period.  Expectations of near-term inflation picked up in October, consistent with the increase in energy prices.  Labor costs continued to rise moderately.  The increase in the employment cost index for private compensation over the third quarter was a bit below the average pace of the last two years.\n",
      "At its meeting of September 21, 2004, the Federal Open Market Committee adopted a directive that called for conditions in reserves markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 1-¾ percent.  In its public statement, the Committee expressed a belief that monetary policy remained accommodative even after this tightening, and judged the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability over the next few quarters to be roughly equal.  The Committee noted its expectation that the underlying rate of inflation would continue to be low and that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured, but also stated that it would nonetheless respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\n",
      "The FOMC’s decision in September to raise the intended level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points and its attendant public statement were anticipated by the market, and the reaction was muted.  Over subsequent weeks, however, a reference in the minutes of the August FOMC meeting to the need for \"significant cumulative tightening\" and comments by the Chairman and other FOMC members, which were read as minimizing the likely damping effect on the economy of higher energy prices, led markets to raise their expectations of forthcoming policy tightenings.  These expectations were boosted further by the release of the strong employment data for October.  The shift in the market’s outlook for monetary policy contributed to noticeable upward pressure on short-term interest rates, and most long-term rates also moved up.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose about in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasuries, but yields on speculative-grade bonds edged down and equity markets posted strong advances.  In foreign exchange markets, the dollar declined appreciably, apparently in part on continuing market concerns about the financing of the U.S. current account deficit.\n",
      "M2 expanded in October at about the sluggish pace of the third quarter.  The growth of M2 was restrained in recent months by increases in its opportunity cost.  Rates paid on its liquid asset components have lagged increases in market rates associated with the three monetary tightenings since midyear. \n",
      "In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand next year at around this year’s solid pace under an assumption of generally accommodative financial conditions.  Recent declines in the dollar were expected to support domestic economic activity by boosting net exports.  Fiscal policy was expected to become much less stimulative after the current quarter, owing to the expiration of the temporary partial-expensing provisions of the tax code.  Oil prices were anticipated to decline somewhat with the repair of hurricane-related damage to oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to some slowing in inflation.  With the economy expected to advance over the coming year at a rate a bit above its longer-run potential, the pace of hiring should firm and the unemployment rate should edge lower.  In response to rising real incomes, consumer spending was forecast to strengthen after the early part of next year.  The staff expected business investment spending to slow sharply early next year as partial-expensing provisions expired, but then to pick up noticeably in response to favorable financing conditions, ample business liquidity, and the need to replace or upgrade aging equipment and software.\n",
      "In the Committee’s discussion of current and prospective developments, the members generally expressed assessments that economic expansion in the neighborhood of the rate of growth of the economy’s potential appeared to have become even more firmly established over recent months, despite the drag from higher energy prices.  Recent data and anecdotal information suggested that spending by businesses and households had been reasonably robust of late, supported by accommodative financial conditions, continuing gains in productivity, and increasing employment.  Looking forward, economic fundamentals appeared to be favorable for continued solid growth, and while fiscal stimulus would abate next year, a flattening out of energy prices, as markets seemed to anticipate, would bolster economic expansion.  However, significant uncertainties surrounded the prospects for energy prices and fiscal policy, as well as the external sector.  The Committee anticipated that underlying inflation pressures would remain contained as monetary accommodation was withdrawn.  Core consumer price inflation had been quite damped on average in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored, despite further increases in energy prices and prospective increases in near-term headline inflation.\n",
      "In their discussion of key sectors of the economy, policymakers noted that business investment had been expanding robustly and was likely to continue to be buoyed by the strength of productivity and profits.  Some sectors, such as trucks and heavy equipment, had experienced rapid growth.  However, even after taking account of likely effects of higher oil prices, the pace of overall business investment spending was still boosting GDP growth somewhat less than might have been expected given accommodative financial conditions and tax incentives.  Some uncertainties, such as those associated with the election, had been resolved, but others persisted, including the prospects for oil prices and their consequences for the economy.  Many business firms seemed hesitant about large-scale investment to increase productive capacity and hiring commitments, perhaps partly reflecting an environment of greater scrutiny regarding corporate governance and internal control systems.  The high-tech sector, and investment in information technology more generally, had been growing less rapidly of late and was seen as posing a possible downside risk to the outlook.  If the recent slower rate of price declines on high-tech products implied a softer underlying pace of technological change, both the outlook for investment demand and the prospects for persisting high trend growth in productivity could be damped relative to previous expectations.\n",
      "While acknowledging data indicating a rebound in consumption spending in recent months, Committee members reported contacts with retail merchants that suggested mixed readings on the ongoing pace of consumer buying.  The effect of higher energy prices on real incomes was likely still restraining consumer spending.  Moreover, the stock of automobiles owned by households had risen substantially in recent years, and the willingness of households to purchase autos was seen as continuing to depend importantly on the provision of incentives by manufacturers.  Home buying and residential construction generally remained robust, although a few members pointed to some moderation in activity in selected markets.  It was noted that a slowdown in the rate of increase in home prices going forward might lead households to increase their desired saving.  However, the risk of any significant drop-off in the growth of consumer spending would likely diminish with a sustained rebound in the pace of hiring.\n",
      "In their comments on fiscal policy, Committee members indicated an expectation that the economic stimulus provided in recent years by discretionary fiscal measures was likely to fade next year.  However, considerable uncertainty surrounded the likely evolution of the federal budget.  Members stressed the importance of fiscal discipline to facilitate a better balance between net national saving and investment and thereby promote an adjustment of the imbalance in the current account of the balance of payments.\n",
      "Committee members noted that the balance of trade had improved a little in September and commented that the decline in the value of the dollar over the past few years had been boosting demand seen by some exporting firms.  However, with foreign economic growth moderating and the large excess of imports over exports, members generally viewed the prospects for net exports as likely to provide a continuing drag on U.S. economic expansion.   One implication of this outlook was that U.S. external indebtedness relative to GDP would be increasing further.\n",
      "Committee members remarked on signs of improvement in labor market conditions.  While acknowledging the need to be cautious about readings from a single labor market report, members saw the increase in payroll employment in October and the upward revisions to previous months as encouraging.  Furthermore, business contacts in several regions were indicating greater difficulty in filling some types of positions, both skilled and unskilled.  Nevertheless, many firms evidently remained slow to expand hiring, in part because of rising benefit costs.  One member commented on the performance of a few key industries, citing evidence that the job losses since the business cycle peak had been driven primarily by weak demand rather than productivity improvements.  Although the extent of economic slack was uncertain, some members indicated a sense that the economy needed to grow faster than trend in order to take up remaining unused resources.\n",
      "Wage and price pressures were generally still modest.  While some firms reportedly were finding it easier to pass higher oil and other commodity costs on to their business customers, most business contacts indicated considerable difficulty in passing cost increases on to consumers.  Longer-term inflation expectations had remained reasonably low, helping to restrain the spillover of elevated energy prices to the prices of other goods and services.  Some members noted that any remaining resource slack would probably exert downward pressure on inflation and that the depreciation of the dollar seemed to be having a muted effect on import prices to date.  However, upside risks to the inflation outlook included possible further depreciation of the dollar or increases in energy prices.  In addition, a few members cited the possibility that the elevated pace of trend productivity growth experienced since the mid-1990s would begin to slow.\n",
      "In the Committee’s discussion of the setting of policy, all of the members favored raising the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2 percent at this meeting.  The economy appeared to be continuing to expand at a moderate pace that was likely to be rapid enough to gradually reduce margins of underutilized resources.  In that regard, the Committee was encouraged by more evident signs of improvement in hiring.  The Committee felt that the outlook justified the further removal of the policy accommodation that had been appropriate when the economic expansion was more tentative.  Today’s action would move the real funds rate, measured using core PCE inflation, toward a more positive setting.\n",
      "In discussing the FOMC announcement for this meeting and going forward, several members commented that policy actions would likely become increasingly dependent on incoming data and their implications for future activity and prices.  This might imply a more gradual path of tightening going forward than that of the last several months, as for example now seemed to be built into the term structure of interest rates, or it might mean that the Committee on occasion would need to firm policy more rapidly.  A few members felt that, because of greater uncertainties, it might become appropriate eventually to move away from the recent practice of providing guidance about the likely future path of policy, while others emphasized the desirability of continuing to be as informative as possible about the Committee’s perceived outlook.  For now, most members agreed that the current statement language provided considerable flexibility with regard to the Committee’s future actions and that market participants understood that flexibility.  As regards the announcement to be released after the meeting, most members felt that little change in the statement language was required.  Policymakers concurred that the statement should indicate that output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, that labor market conditions have improved, and that inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.  They agreed to characterize the risks to sustainable growth and price stability as balanced and to reiterate that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured but that the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability.\n",
      "At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive.\n",
      "\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.

      "The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets.  There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.\n",
      "The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the economy had a good deal of forward momentum in the third quarter.  Although recent hurricanes caused considerable damage and disruption, particularly in the energy sector, economic activity outside the Gulf region appeared to have been well maintained.  In September, hiring in other regions remained in line with its pace over the preceding twelve months, and excluding the estimated effects of the hurricanes and a strike by Boeing machinists, industrial production increased briskly.  In addition, residential construction remained buoyant.  Consumer spending, however, showed some signs of weakening.  Although consumer spending was strong for the third quarter as a whole, it softened in September, and survey measures of consumer confidence slumped noticeably.  Despite the large increase in consumer energy prices since midyear, core price inflation was restrained through September.\n",
      "Hurricane Rita caused further disruption to energy production in the Gulf area, which had not yet fully recovered from Hurricane Katrina.  Energy production in October was still below pre-hurricane levels, although progress had been made in reopening shut-down energy facilities.  Rising imports, along with more-subdued consumption of gasoline and other petroleum products, helped to offset the effect on energy prices of some of the output losses in refined products.  In addition, to address the low level of gasoline inventories and more-immediate retail demands, domestic refiners sharply increased the share of gasoline in their output of total refined product.  Wholesale and retail gasoline prices spiked soon after Rita's landfall but had since declined to pre-hurricane levels.  Spot prices for natural gas soared with the hurricanes and remained at elevated levels.\n",
      "Payroll employment fell in September, held down by substantial job losses associated with Hurricane Katrina.  Employment in the areas unaffected by the hurricane increased at a rate in line with the average pace over the previous twelve months.  The largest employment loss occurred in the leisure and hospitality category, an industry particularly hard hit by the storm.  The average workweek was unchanged in September, so with employment lower, aggregate hours declined slightly.  The unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage points to 5.1 percent.  The labor force participation rate held steady, but the number of individuals reporting that they had a job but were not at work because of bad weather surged.  More recently, weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance suggested that the job losses associated with the hurricane were subsiding. \n",
      "Industrial production fell substantially in September, but excluding the effects of hurricane-related disturbances and the Boeing strike, industrial production was estimated to have risen at a brisk pace.  The hurricanes caused the index for oil and natural gas extraction and refining to plummet in September, and they also significantly affected petrochemical production.  Manufacturing output fell noticeably in the shipbuilding, food manufacturing, paper, and plywood industries.  In the transportation equipment category, motor vehicle production climbed notably, but the machinists' strike at Boeing caused the company to cease nearly all commercial aircraft production during the month.  High-tech output--led by strong gains in the production of semiconductors and communications equipment--surged in September.  Manufacturing capacity utilization dropped substantially in September, but was still noticeably above its year-earlier level.\n",
      "Real consumer spending increased at a moderate rate in the third quarter as a whole, although it declined in August and September after having risen substantially earlier in the summer.  The softening in spending of late reflected in part the diminishing boost to light vehicle sales from manufacturers' programs offering employee discounts to nonemployees.  Spending on other goods and services was also sluggish, likely because of the direct effects of the dislocation of households by the hurricanes, high energy prices, and falling consumer confidence.  Consumer sentiment in October, as measured by both the Michigan Survey and the Conference Board's indicator, dropped a little further after plunging in September.  The personal saving rate remained slightly negative in September.\n",
      "Residential construction continued at a robust pace.  In September, new single-family homes were started at a rate a bit above their elevated average rate in the first half of the year, and permit issuance jumped to a new high.  New home sales remained substantial in August, but they were below July's elevated level.  Although they remained low by historical standards, both the thirty-year fixed mortgage rate and the one-year adjustable rate had moved up a bit in recent months and were notably above the levels seen at the beginning of the year.  The average selling price of existing homes rose in the twelve months ending in September at about the same rapid clip as a year earlier, but the average selling price of new homes rose more slowly over the past few months.\n",
      "Real outlays for equipment and software were sluggish in the summer, but a broad-based pickup in orders for and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft in August suggested some firming.  Investment fundamentals remained relatively solid, including continued expansion in business sales, a declining cost of capital, and corporate balance sheets that were flush with cash.  Surveys of executive sentiment squared well with the fundamentals:  Although business leaders expressed some misgivings about the overall macroeconomic environment, their stated capital spending intentions pointed to increasing investment.  Vacancy rates for nonresidential properties continued to edge lower, but they remained elevated for office and industrial properties, and real spending on new construction had yet to improve materially.\n",
      "Business investment in real nonfarm inventories was subdued over the summer.  Although inventory-to-sales ratios moved down some in July and August, businesses did not appear dissatisfied with their level of stocks.  For example, September results from the Institute for Supply Management survey indicated that respondents viewed their customers' current inventory situation as reasonably well aligned with demand.\n",
      "The U.S. international trade deficit widened somewhat in August, as a surge in imports of goods and services was partially offset by a sizable gain in exports.  The growth in imports reflected both a marked increase in oil imports and a rise in nonoil goods; imports of services were little changed.  The increase in exports was driven by higher merchandise exports, although exports of services also advanced a bit.  GDP growth in foreign industrial economies appeared to have continued at a moderate pace in the third quarter.\n",
      "Soaring energy prices have boosted overall measures of consumer price inflation in recent months.  However, measures of core consumer price inflation were much more restrained.  The twelve-month change in core consumer prices through September was about unchanged from its year-earlier level.  One survey of households in October found that expectations for inflation over the coming year rose to a level well above the readings that had prevailed over the spring and summer, presumably in response to rising energy prices.  However, median expectations for inflation over the next five to ten years were only a little above the average range reported in recent years.  With regard to labor costs, the employment cost index for private industry workers rose at a moderate pace in the third quarter, up somewhat from its second-quarter pace, but the twelve-month change in the index declined from that of a year earlier.  Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector was estimated to have also risen at a moderate rate in the third quarter.\n",
      "At its September meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase the target level of the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 3¾ percent.  In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.  The Committee noted that the widespread devastation in the Gulf region from Hurricane Katrina, the associated dislocation of economic activity, and the boost to energy prices would set back spending, production, and employment in the near term.  However, the Committee judged that these unfortunate developments did not pose a more persistent threat to the overall economy.  Rather, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, was providing ongoing support to economic activity.  Although higher energy and other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressure, core inflation had been relatively low in the preceding few months and longer-term inflation expectations remained contained.  In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\n",
      "With investors putting only small odds on a pause in the tightening cycle following Hurricane Katrina, there was little market reaction to the Committee's decision at the September meeting.  However, the expected path for monetary policy shifted up in subsequent weeks, as incoming data indicated that output had been expanding briskly prior to the hurricanes and that the disruptions to economic activity from the hurricanes were likely to be less severe than initially feared.  This upward pressure on interest rates may have been amplified by comments from a number of Federal Reserve officials that were read as stressing inflation concerns.  Nominal Treasury yields rose in line with the shift in the outlook for monetary policy.  Despite a large increase in the overall consumer price index for September, measures of inflation compensation calculated using yields on nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities were about unchanged over the intermeeting period, although they remained a bit above the levels seen before Hurricane Katrina.  As broad indexes of investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields moved largely in line with Treasury yields over the period, spreads were little changed.  Major stock price indexes fell moderately and the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated slightly over the intermeeting period.\n",
      "Domestic nonfinancial debt appeared to have advanced briskly in the third quarter.  Growth in household debt was estimated to have edged down in the third quarter because of a slowing in mortgage debt growth but remained elevated.  Household bankruptcies surged in the weeks immediately before bankruptcy reforms went into effect on October 17.  The debt of nonfinancial businesses rose in the third quarter at a rate comparable to the increases seen in the first half of the year.  Bank loans to businesses continued to advance briskly, and the results of the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey showed some further easing of lending terms and standards for such loans.  M2 expanded at a fairly solid rate in September.  The increase in September was in part attributable to a boost to currency and liquid deposits resulting from Hurricane Katrina.  Growth in nominal output in the third quarter exceeded that of M2, implying a further rise in velocity.\n",
      "In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff continued to project moderate economic growth for the second half of 2005.  Output growth was expected to pick up in 2006, as the boost from hurricane-related rebuilding activity more than offset the effects of somewhat tighter financial conditions, and then slow in 2007, as the impetus from rebuilding waned.  The near-term forecast again entailed a marked downshift in headline inflation as energy prices fall back consistent with readings from futures markets.  Favorable incoming data led the staff to reduce its forecast for near-term core inflation a bit.  The outlook continued to be for core inflation to pick up modestly over coming quarters owing to the lagged effects of higher energy prices but then to return to near current levels in 2007 primarily as the result of the restraining influence of falling energy prices.\n",
      "In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants saw the economy as continuing to grow at a solid pace, notwithstanding the disruptive effects to economic activity and employment from the hurricanes.  However, the near-term outlook continued to be subject to considerable uncertainty given the difficulties in assessing the net effects of the downturn in consumer confidence and the rise in energy prices through the summer, on the one hand, and the rebuilding from hurricane damage, on the other.  Although oil and gasoline prices had fallen in recent weeks and core inflation had remained benign, some businesses had reported increased ability to pass through cost increases in the environment of higher headline inflation.  On balance, meeting participants remained concerned about heightened inflation pressures.\n",
      "Meeting participants generally saw accumulating evidence as supporting the view that the disruptions to aggregate economic activity and employment from the hurricanes were likely to be limited and temporary.  In areas that had been devastated by the hurricanes, recovery of energy production and the rebuilding of homes and businesses might take longer than had been expected, in part because of a slow return of evacuees.  However, in regions just outside those that were most severely damaged, recovery was already well underway, and the pace of economic activity had strengthened, in some cases owing to spending by relocated households.  Reconstruction along the Gulf Coast would likely pick up substantially in the next couple of quarters.\n",
      "In the household sector, spending seemed to have held up fairly well, aside from a drop in purchases of autos.  Some participants noted, however, that the erosion of consumer confidence, still-elevated gasoline prices, and the prospect of higher heating bills might augur weakness ahead.  The housing market had remained robust, although a slowing in house price gains in some areas and recent declines in home equity lending at banks could be indicating that the long-expected cooling in the housing market was near.  Motor vehicle purchases had slowed substantially in October, but that seemed to owe primarily to the end of discount programs that had generated a surge in auto spending over the summer.  Over the longer-term, with house price gains moderating and perhaps greater perceived needs to invest for retirement purposes, the household saving rate was likely to rise gradually.\n",
      "Growth in business investment spending seemed to remain moderate overall, but anecdotal reports suggested that a number of firms had boosted their plans for capital spending.  Moreover, construction spending and commercial real estate investment seemed to be picking up in some areas.  Significant problems persisted amongst U.S. nameplates in the auto sector, however.  The rise in longer-term real interest rates and some widening of private credit spreads in recent months were seen as perhaps having a little restraining effect on the investment outlook.\n",
      "Economic growth in the near term was likely to be boosted by additional fiscal stimulus, in part to support recovery and rebuilding from the hurricanes.  Strong demand from overseas was evidently boosting exports this year by more than the increase in imports, with the nation's external accounts thereby providing a small net positive contribution to growth in domestic production.  Next year, however, the arithmetic contribution to growth from net exports was seen as likely to return to negative territory.\n",
      "While participants noted some recent favorable data on core inflation and labor costs, upside risks to the outlook for underlying inflation remained a key concern.  Wage gains had remained modest relative to continued strong productivity growth, suggesting that labor costs were not putting much upward pressure on prices.  Indeed, core inflation continued to be subdued, and in recent weeks gasoline prices had unwound a significant portion of their steep increases.  Nevertheless, there was a risk that the large cumulative rise in energy and petroleum product prices through the summer would be transmitted to core consumer prices.  A number of firms had been reporting a greater ability to pass through increases in energy and other costs to customers, though evidently more so to other businesses than to consumers.  A survey measure of the near-term inflation expectations of households had risen notably, but intermediate- and longer-term inflation expectations implied by Treasury security yields had remained fairly stable.  It was noted, however, that longer-term expectations of inflation remained contained in the context of an increase in the extent of additional monetary policy tightening expected in financial markets. \n",
      "In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, all members favored raising the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4 percent at this meeting.  The economy seemed to be growing at a fairly strong pace, despite the temporary disruptions associated with the hurricanes, and underlying economic slack was likely quite limited.  In that context, all members believed it important to continue removing monetary policy accommodation in order to check upside risks to inflation and keep inflation expectations contained, but noted that policy setting would need to be increasingly sensitive to incoming economic data.  Some members cautioned that risks of going too far with the tightening process could also eventually emerge.  Nonetheless, all members agreed to indicate at the conclusion of this meeting that a continued measured pace of policy firming remained likely.\n",
      "In their ongoing discussion of the Committee's communication strategy, participants expressed a variety of perspectives about how the policy statement issued at the end of FOMC meetings might evolve over time.  Several aspects of the statement language would have to be changed before long, particularly those related to the characterization of and outlook for policy.  Possible future changes in the sentence on the balance of risks to the Committee's objectives were also discussed.  Participants noted that any forward-looking elements of the statement should clearly be conditioned on the outlook for inflation and economic growth.  For this meeting, members concurred that the current statement structure could be retained, as it accurately conveyed their near-term economic and policy outlook.\n",
      "In view of the continued rapid pace of observed productivity gains, members agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should again indicate that robust underlying productivity growth and monetary policy accommodation were supporting the economic expansion.  Those influences were expected to be augmented by planned rebuilding and recovery activity in hurricane-affected areas.  While gasoline prices had recently moved lower, the cumulative rise in energy prices and other costs was seen as having the potential to add to inflation pressures.  However, core inflation had been subdued in recent months and longer-run inflation expectations remained contained.  Against that backdrop, the risks to the objective of price stability, as well as that for sustainable growth, remained in balance, given appropriate monetary policy actions. \n",
      "At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:\n",
      "\"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks   monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4 percent.\"\n",
      "The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting:\n",

Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.\"\n",
